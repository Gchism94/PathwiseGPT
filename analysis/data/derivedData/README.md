# Overview
This repository contains a structured framework that defines machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models suitable for different tasks across various data types, including image, time series, audio, and tabular data. The framework provides a mapping between tasks and the appropriate algorithms based on specific requirements, such as dataset size, the need for real-time processing, model interpretability, and task complexity.

# How to Use
Identify the data type and task you are working on (e.g., image classification, time series forecasting, audio classification).
Refer to the relevant section of this framework to find a suitable ML/DL model based on your task's characteristics (e.g., dataset size, real-time requirements).
Select the recommended model to implement in your project. For example, if you're working with image classification on a large dataset, the framework suggests using Deep CNNs or Vision Transformers.
# Model Recommendations
ML models are often suggested for smaller datasets or when interpretability is important.
DL models are recommended for larger datasets and complex tasks, especially when performance and accuracy are prioritized over interpretability.
For tasks that require real-time processing, lightweight architectures are preferred for better speed.
