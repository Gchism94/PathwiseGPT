Following the [Rose/Bud/Thorn](https://www.panoramaed.com/blog/rose-bud-thorn-activity-and-worksheet#:~:text=%22Rose%2C%20Bud%2C%20Thorn%22%20is%20a%20mindful%20design%2D,day%2C%20week%2C%20or%20month.) model:

### Rose:
The highlight of this session was successfully implementing logic generation and model validation across diverse data types such as image, time-series, audio, and tabular datasets. It was exciting to see how consistent patterns could be applied across domains, with the modular structure making the code both reusable and easy to extend. A particularly rewarding moment was seeing the dynamic decision logic seamlessly recommend models, reinforcing the practical applicability of our framework.

### Bud: 
Looking forward, I am eager to test the framework on larger, more complex datasets to evaluate its scalability and refine its adaptability. Expanding the logic to accommodate hybrid datasets and exploring advanced validation techniques are exciting opportunities. These enhancements could make the framework more versatile and further optimize its real-time decision-making capabilities.

### Thorn: 
One challenge we encountered was ensuring fallback models were appropriately triggered without overriding valid recommendations in edge cases. Initially, default models were returned for unrecognized conditions, requiring revisions to the logic. Although this issue was resolved, it underscored the importance of robust validation to maintain accuracy as the framework grows in complexity.
