Efficient algorithms for decision tree cross-validation,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0110036v1,"Cross-validation is a useful and generally applicable technique often
employed in machine learning, including decision tree induction. An important
disadvantage of straightforward implementation of the technique is its
computational overhead. In this paper we show that, for decision trees, the
computational overhead of cross-validation can be reduced significantly by
integrating the cross-validation with the normal decision tree induction
process. We discuss how existing decision tree algorithms can be adapted to
this aim, and provide an analysis of the speedups these adaptations may yield.
The analysis is supported by experimental results."
Stability Analysis for Regularized Least Squares Regression,http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0502016v1,"We discuss stability for a class of learning algorithms with respect to noisy
labels. The algorithms we consider are for regression, and they involve the
minimization of regularized risk functionals, such as L(f) := 1/N sum_i
(f(x_i)-y_i)^2+ lambda ||f||_H^2. We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when
y_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the
algorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously
vanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N
points remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N
-> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is
the expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we
describe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give
conditions for convergence. In the process, we develop a set of tools for
dealing with functionals such as L(f), which are applicable to many other
problems in learning theory."
Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization,http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.1274v1,"This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo
Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning
(PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four
contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad
class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application
domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce
immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm
for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO
problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two
contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution
we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and
bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures
ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated
values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations
are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location
information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample
locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an
additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO."
Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning,http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3390v2,"We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a
block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger
than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual
regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is
commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model
consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model
misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced
by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually
referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from
heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools
from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the
consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an
adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary
condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied."
Consistency of trace norm minimization,http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.2848v1,"Regularization by the sum of singular values, also referred to as the trace
norm, is a popular technique for estimating low rank rectangular matrices. In
this paper, we extend some of the consistency results of the Lasso to provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for rank consistency of trace norm
minimization with the square loss. We also provide an adaptive version that is
rank consistent even when the necessary condition for the non adaptive version
is not fulfilled."
"A New Approach to Collaborative Filtering: Operator Estimation with
  Spectral Regularization",http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.1430v2,"We present a general approach for collaborative filtering (CF) using spectral
regularization to learn linear operators from ""users"" to the ""objects"" they
rate. Recent low-rank type matrix completion approaches to CF are shown to be
special cases. However, unlike existing regularization based CF methods, our
approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the
users or the objects -- a limitation of existing regularization based CF
methods. We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new
estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank
decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments
indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF
methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we
show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases
of our proposed approach."
A Quadratic Loss Multi-Class SVM,http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.4898v1,"Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters:
the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this
model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its
leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization
error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time
requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the
leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among
those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It
applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the
2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2,
as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this
machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established."
Graph Kernels,http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0093v1,"We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which
include the random walk graph kernel ,
marginalized graph kernel ,
and geometric kernel on graphs . Through extensions of linear
algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and reduction to a
Sylvester equation, we construct an algorithm that improves the time complexity
of kernel computation from  to . When the graphs are sparse,
conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations bring our algorithm into
the sub-cubic domain. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other
application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster
than previous approaches. We then explore connections between diffusion kernels
, regularization on graphs , and graph kernels,
and use these connections to propose new graph kernels. Finally, we show that
rational kernels  when specialized
to graphs reduce to the random walk graph kernel."
When is there a representer theorem? Vector versus matrix regularizers,http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1590v1,"We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of
parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the
regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned
vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the
representer theorem, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine
learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby
completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We
further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a
problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this
context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger
class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for
these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete
examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from
matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing function."
Stability Bound for Stationary Phi-mixing and Beta-mixing Processes,http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1629v1,"Most generalization bounds in learning theory are based on some measure of
the complexity of the hypothesis class used, independently of any algorithm. In
contrast, the notion of algorithmic stability can be used to derive tight
generalization bounds that are tailored to specific learning algorithms by
exploiting their particular properties. However, as in much of learning theory,
existing stability analyses and bounds apply only in the scenario where the
samples are independently and identically distributed. In many machine learning
applications, however, this assumption does not hold. The observations received
by the learning algorithm often have some inherent temporal dependence.
  This paper studies the scenario where the observations are drawn from a
stationary phi-mixing or beta-mixing sequence, a widely adopted assumption in
the study of non-i.i.d. processes that implies a dependence between
observations weakening over time. We prove novel and distinct stability-based
generalization bounds for stationary phi-mixing and beta-mixing sequences.
These bounds strictly generalize the bounds given in the i.i.d. case and apply
to all stable learning algorithms, thereby extending the use of
stability-bounds to non-i.i.d. scenarios.
  We also illustrate the application of our phi-mixing generalization bounds to
general classes of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Regression,
Kernel Ridge Regression, and Support Vector Machines, and many other kernel
regularization-based and relative entropy-based regularization algorithms.
These novel bounds can thus be viewed as the first theoretical basis for the
use of these algorithms in non-i.i.d. scenarios."
"Stability Analysis and Learning Bounds for Transductive Regression
  Algorithms",http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0814v1,"This paper uses the notion of algorithmic stability to derive novel
generalization bounds for several families of transductive regression
algorithms, both by using convexity and closed-form solutions. Our analysis
helps compare the stability of these algorithms. It also shows that a number of
widely used transductive regression algorithms are in fact unstable. Finally,
it reports the results of experiments with local transductive regression
demonstrating the benefit of our stability bounds for model selection, for one
of the algorithms, in particular for determining the radius of the local
neighborhood used by the algorithm."
"A Bayesian Model for Supervised Clustering with the Dirichlet Process
  Prior",http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0808v1,"We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering
problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching,
coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering
model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define
distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this
problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of
unobserved random variables (we call these ""reference types"") that are generic
across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating
over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo
techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors.
We present a simple--but general--parameterization of our model based on a
Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three
real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art
supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform
other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics."
"Collaborative Filtering in a Non-Uniform World: Learning with the
  Weighted Trace Norm",http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2780v1,"We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be
significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly. We
introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also
with non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the
(highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset."
Adaptive Bound Optimization for Online Convex Optimization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4908v2,"We introduce a new online convex optimization algorithm that adaptively
chooses its regularization function based on the loss functions observed so
far. This is in contrast to previous algorithms that use a fixed regularization
function such as L2-squared, and modify it only via a single time-dependent
parameter. Our algorithm's regret bounds are worst-case optimal, and for
certain realistic classes of loss functions they are much better than existing
bounds. These bounds are problem-dependent, which means they can exploit the
structure of the actual problem instance. Critically, however, our algorithm
does not need to know this structure in advance. Rather, we prove competitive
guarantees that show the algorithm provides a bound within a constant factor of
the best possible bound (of a certain functional form) in hindsight."
Model Selection with the Loss Rank Principle,http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0516v1,"A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to automatically select the
""right"" model complexity, e.g., the number of neighbors to be averaged over in
k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree in regression with
polynomials. We suggest a novel principle - the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) -
for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss
rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better.
LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized
maximum likelihood variants (AIC, BIC, MDL), LoRP depends only on the
regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise
model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN."
"Asymptotic Equivalence of Bayes Cross Validation and Widely Applicable
  Information Criterion in Singular Learning Theory",http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.2316v2,"In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is
asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since
many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior
of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established
the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information
criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the
average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically
compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information
criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is
asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a
random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization
using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the
Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is
asymptotically equal to , where  is the real log canonical
threshold and  is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation
between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined
by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify
that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes
cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion."
"Filtrage vaste marge pour l'étiquetage séquentiel à noyaux de
  signaux",http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0824v1,"We address in this paper the problem of multi-channel signal sequence
labeling. In particular, we consider the problem where the signals are
contaminated by noise or may present some dephasing with respect to their
labels. For that, we propose to jointly learn a SVM sample classifier with a
temporal filtering of the channels. This will lead to a large margin filtering
that is adapted to the specificity of each channel (noise and time-lag). We
derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem and we discuss different
filter regularizations for automated scaling or selection of channels. Our
approach is tested on a non-linear toy example and on a BCI dataset. Results
show that the classification performance on these problems can be improved by
learning a large margin filtering."
"A Unified View of Regularized Dual Averaging and Mirror Descent with
  Implicit Updates",http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.3240v2,"We study three families of online convex optimization algorithms:
follow-the-proximally-regularized-leader (FTRL-Proximal), regularized dual
averaging (RDA), and composite-objective mirror descent. We first prove
equivalence theorems that show all of these algorithms are instantiations of a
general FTRL update. This provides theoretical insight on previous experimental
observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent
algorithm handles L1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that RDA
is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that
FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds,
leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in
closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two,
and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.
  Our second contribution is a unified analysis which produces regret bounds
that match (up to logarithmic terms) or improve the best previously known
bounds. This analysis also extends these algorithms in two important ways: we
support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit
updates, which replace the subgradient approximation of the current loss
function with an exact optimization."
Efficient L1/Lq Norm Regularization,http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4766v1,"Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas
including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm
regularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many
applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group
sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however,
challenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization.
Existing work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they
cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an
efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the
L1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than
1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the
proposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our
theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why
EP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the
special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient
algorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results
demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm."
"Multi-parametric Solution-path Algorithm for Instance-weighted Support
  Vector Machines",http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.4791v2,"An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has
attracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various
machine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic
data modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An
important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational
bottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus
the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we
develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM
solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this
contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path
algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight
parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that
breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in
high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric
representation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation
in weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the
current affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at
intersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through
extensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the
usefulness of the proposed algorithm."
